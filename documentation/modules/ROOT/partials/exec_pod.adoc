Check that the pod is up and running:

[source, shell-session, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl get pods

NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
{podname}   1/1     Running   0          5s
----

Then let's go into the running pod to execute some commands:

[source, shell-session, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl exec -ti {podname} /bin/bash
----

NOTE: Change the pod name with your pod name.
