= Kubernetes Secrets with Encryption
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Kubernetes introduced several new security features in version 1.7.X, one of these is the ability to encrypt/decrypt secrets automatically.
This new feature is called `Secret Data at Rest`.

To enable it you need to do two things:

. Create a configuration file for encryption. 
. Tell `kube-apiserver` about this configuration file.

== Encrypting Data at Rest

The first thing you need to do is create an encryption key.
To generate this key you can use the next command:

[source, shell-session]
----
head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64 -i -

b6sjdRWAPhtacXo8mO1cfgVYWXzwuls3T3NQOo4TBhk=
----

The next step is to create an encryption config file where `kube-apiserver` is configured.
In the case of minikube, run the next command in a terminal:

[source, shell-session]
----
minikube ssh

                         _             _
            _         _ ( )           ( )
  ___ ___  (_)  ___  (_)| |/')  _   _ | |_      __
/' _ ` _ `\| |/' _ `\| || , <  ( ) ( )| '_`\  /'__`\
| ( ) ( ) || || ( ) || || |\`\ | (_) || |_) )(  ___/
(_) (_) (_)(_)(_) (_)(_)(_) (_)`\___/'(_,__/'`\____)

sudo -i
----

TIP: If you get an error like `ðŸ’£  Error getting config:`, then you need to specify the minikube profile as well with `-p` flag. `minikube ssh -p vault`

Within the minikube, create the next encryption config file at `/var/lib/minikube/certs/encryptionconfig.yaml`:

[source, shell-session]
----
echo "
include::example$encryption-config.yml[]
"  | tee /var/lib/minikube/certs/encryptionconfig.yaml
----
<1> Update it with the key you generated before.

Then `exit` the SSH terminal (twice) and restart minikube by running the next command:

[source, shell-session]
----
minikube stop

minikube start -p vault --vm-driver=virtualbox --extra-config=apiserver.encryption-provider-config=/var/lib/minikube/certs/encryptionconfig.yaml
----

Then create a new secret:

[source, shell-session]
----
kubectl create secret generic db-secret-encrypted --from-literal=username=devuser --from-literal=password=devpassword
----

To validate that secrets are encrypted now in `etcd`, run the next commands:

:etcdpath: /registry/secrets/default/db-secret-enrypted
include::partial$etcdctl.adoc[]

And the output:

[source, shell-session]
----
/registry/secrets/default/db-secret-encrypted
cmï¿½9>ï¿½*ï¿½-ï¿½ï¿½Ú‚ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½È®ï¿½~ï¿½6Iï¿½'ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½=\@ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½eï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.ï¿½ï¿½

Notice that now the content is encrypted.

== Is Enough in this way?

Encrypting secrets with a locally managed key protects against an etcd compromise, but not against a host compromise as the encryption keys are stored on the same host and in plain text.
So, you are encrypting the data, but putting in the same place the key to decrypt, the situation has been improved, but still 

Moreover, this approach has the next problems:

* The keys needs to be generated manually.
* Key management is done manually.
* Key rotation is a manual process.

This might be ok, in your case, but Kubernetes also implements a way to plugin Key Management Services (KMS) plugins for data encryption.
In this way, key management and encryption storage are in separated hosts.

In the next section, you'll learn about Vault and how to integrate it with KMS.
