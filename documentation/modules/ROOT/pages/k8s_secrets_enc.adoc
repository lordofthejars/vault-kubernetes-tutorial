= Kubernetes Secrets with Encryption
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Kubernetes introduced several new security features in version 1.7.X, one of these is the ability to encrypt/decrypt secrets automatically.
This new feature is called `Secret Data at Rest`.

To enable it you need to do two things:

. Create a configuration file for encryption. 
. Tell `kube-apiserver` about this configuration file.

.Encryption occurs in the master host with key stored there.

== Encrypting data at Rest

The first thing you need to do is create an encryption key.
To generate this key you can use the next command:

[source, shell-session]
----
head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64 -i -

----

include::partial$ssh_minikube.adoc[]

Inside the minikube VM, you need to create a config file at `/var/lib/minikube/certs/encryptionconfig.yaml`, to do it, just execute the next `echo` command into the SSH'd instance:

[source, shell-session]
----
echo "
include::example$encryption-config.yml[]
"  | tee /var/lib/minikube/certs/encryptionconfig.yaml
----
<1> Update it with the key you generated before.

Then `exit` the SSH terminal (twice) and restart minikube by running the next command:

[source, shell-session]
----
minikube stop

minikube start -p vault --vm-driver=virtualbox --extra-config=apiserver.encryption-provider-config=/var/lib/minikube/certs/encryptionconfig.yaml
----

=== Create a secret

Then create a new secret:

[source, shell-session]
----
kubectl create secret generic db-secret-encrypted --from-literal=username=devuser --from-literal=password=devpassword
----

To validate that secrets are encrypted now in `etcd`, run the next commands:

:etcdpath: /registry/secrets/default/db-secret-encrypted
include::partial$etcdctl.adoc[]

And the output:

[source, shell-session]
----
/registry/secrets/default/db-secret-encrypted
cm�9>�*�-��ڂ���Ȯ�~�6I�'���=\@����e����.��
                         8Y
t��p �`b�                  ��V����w��6�̒��l��v��"Ey\�q.�`^�Z��n�xh��$���d놸�1��y��Q��q��LJј}ߧ�������I�w��%;�UT�<}������[&�b�~��cB
----

Notice that now the content is encrypted.

After that, you can stop the port-forwarding process.

=== Recap

* [x] You need to enable the `Secret Data at Rest` at `kube-apiserver` so secrets are encrypted too.

== Is Enough in this way?

Encrypting secrets with a locally managed key protects against an etcd compromise, but not against a host compromise as the encryption keys are stored on the same host and in plain text.
So, you are encrypting the data, but putting in the same place the key to decrypt, the situation has been improved, but still 

Moreover, this approach has the next problems:

* The keys need to be generated manually.
* Key management is done manually.
* Key rotation is a manual process.

This might be ok and you can accept it, but Kubernetes also implements a way to plugin Key Management Services (KMS) plugins for data encryption.
In this way, key management and encryption storage are in separate hosts.

In the next section, you'll learn about Vault and how to integrate it with KMS.
