= Vault and KMS
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets.
Vault provides a unified interface to any secret while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.

The most important features in Vault are:

Secure Secret Storage:: Acts as a key/value store of secrets. These secrets are encrypted by Vault before they are stored.
Dynamic Secrets:: Generates secrets on-demand for some systems. For example, when app needs to access the database, Vault generates a valid username and password to access it.
Data Encryption:: Encrypt and decrypts data without storing it (transit). You can think like encryption-as-a-service approach.
Leasing and Renewal:: Secrets have a lease associated with them. You can renew them.
Revocation:: Secrets can be revoked with a simple method.
Audit:: Auditing provides a history of all operations performed by Vault. This can be used as a forensics trail in the case of misuse or compromise of the system.

[#kms]
== KMS

As stated in the previous section, encrypting secrets and storing the key in the same place is not the most secure thing you can do.

Key Management System (KMS) encryption provider uses an envelope encryption scheme to encrypt data in etcd.

.Encryption occurs in the KMS.

[#kmsvault]
== Vault as KMS

Let's use Vault as KMS and use its capability to encrypt and decrypt data in transit to encrypt and decrypt the Kubernetes secret.

.Encryption occurs in the Vault system in transit mode.

=== Installing Vault

For the sake of simplicity, now we are going to add Vault inside the Virtual Machine that is running the Kubernetes cluster, but outside of it.

In a real scenario, you should put Vault outside the Kubernetes cluster, probably in a dedicated server, and configure it so the communication betweenthe cluster and Vault is possible.
But this is out-of-scope of the tutorial.

A script is provided to install and configure Vault inside the minikube VM as KMS service:

[source, shell-session]
----
minikube ssh -p secrets-vault "$(cat ./scripts/install_vault_kms.sh)"
----

=== Create a secret

Then create a new secret:

[source, shell-session]
----
kubectl create secret generic db-secret-encrypted-kms --from-literal=username=devuser --from-literal=password=devpassword
----

To validate that secrets are encrypted now in `etcd`, run the next commands:

:etcdpath: /registry/secrets/default/db-secret-encrypted-kms
include::partial$etcdctl.adoc[]

And the output:

[source, shell-session]
----
/registry/secrets/default/db-secret-encrypted-kms
k8s:enc:kms:v1:vault:Zmy-key:v1:8IQCbgEQ6/lB3lkkdGtUnosG0ckmXhDNaQNwJ153M5arhsH9QJcd3kG0ur2iA4zWqxIvSDn+k1KYhw4y�y]7�ꭝ��

----

After that, you can stop the port-forwarding process.

=== Recap

* [x] Kubernetes can leverage to a KMS to encrypt secrets.
* [x] Vault is a valid option to be used as a KMS in Kubernetes.

=== Clean-up

[#vaulteverywhere]
== Vault everywhere

So far, you've seen that all problems regarding securing correctly the secrets in Kubernetes have been fixed.
Injecting the secret as an environment variable or as a volume has explained in xref:k8s_secrets.adoc#usesecrets[Using Secrets] section.

Doing in that way might be perfectly valid in most of the cases, but there are still some missing use cases:

* Leasing and renewal of the secrets, how to react when a secret is updated (ie dynamic secrets).
* The secret is injected inside the pod, anyone with access to the pod can find the mounted volumes hence print the secrets.
* Revoking secrets at once.

For this reason, if you find that these use cases are important to you, you can start using Vault generally and not just in the transit method.
