= Kubernetes Secrets

Kubernetes Secrets let you store and manage sensitive information in a safer and more flexible way than putting it directly in the pod.

[#createsecrets]
== Creating secrets

Secrets can be created using `kubectl` or in a file formatted in `JSON` or `YAML`.

=== Creating secrets using `kubectl`

Assuming `kubectl` pointing to your Kubernetes cluster, run the net command in the terminal window:

[source, shell-session]
----
kubectl create secret generic db-secret --from-literal=username=devuser --from-literal=password=devpassword

secret/db-secret created
----

You can list the secrets by running:

[source, shell-session]
----
kubectl get secrets

NAME                  TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
db-secret             Opaque                                2      47s
----

NOTE: Special characters such as `$`, `\`, `*`, and `!` will be interpreted by your shell and require escaping. 
In most shells, the easiest way to escape the password is to surround it with single quotes (`'`) char.

=== Creating secrets using file 

You can create the same secret as the previous section using a file.
The first thing you need to do is to encode to base64 the secrets.
This process is done automatically when using `kubectl create secret`.

[source, shell-session]
----
echo -n 'devuser' | base64
ZGV2dXNlcg==

echo -n 'devpassword' | base64
ZGV2cGFzc3dvcmQ=
----

You can create the secret by running:

[source, shell-session, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes/secretfile.yml

secret/db-secret-file created
----

The file looks like:

[source, yaml]
.secretfile.yml
----
include::example$secretfile.yml[]
----

You can list the secrets by running:

[source, shell-session]
----
kubectl get secrets

NAME                  TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
db-secret             Opaque                                2      15m
db-secret-file        Opaque                                2      4s
----

You can also use the `stringData` field to put a non-base64 encoded string directly into the Secret.
This allows to create configuration files accordantly to the framework you are using in your pod.
For example, in Quarkus, you can use `application.properties` to configure the application.
To set the secrets of this file, you can do it by using the `stringData` field.

You can create the secret by running:

[source, shell-session, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes/secretquarkus.yml

secret/db-secret-file-quarkus created
----

The file looks like:

[source, yaml]
.secretquarkus.yml
----
include::example$secretquarkus.yml[]
----

You can list the secrets by running:

[source, shell-session]
----
kubectl get secrets

NAME                     TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
db-secret                Opaque                                2      35m
db-secret-file           Opaque                                2      20m
db-secret-file-quarkus   Opaque                                1      4s

[#usesecrets]
== Using secrets

=== Using secrets as environment variables

You can inject a secret as an environment inside the pod.

[source, shell-session]
----
kubectl apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes/deploygreetingenv.yml

serviceaccount/greeting created
service/greeting created
deployment.apps/greeting created
----

Important part of the previous deployment file:

[source, yaml]
.deploygreetingenv.yml
----
include::example$deploygreetingenv.yml[tags=spec, indent=0]
----
<1> Environment variable where secret is injected.
<2> Secret name to get the secrets.
<3> Key name of the secret to inject.

:podname: greeting-75685d6668-szt8d
include::partial$exec_pod.adoc[]

Inside the pod:

[source, shell-session]
----
bash-4.4$ env
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
HOSTNAME=greeting-75685d6668-szt8d
GREETING_SERVICE_HOST=10.96.95.7
USERNAME=devuser // <1>
GREETING_SERVICE_PORT=8080

bash-4.4$ exit
----
<1> The secret is injected as env. variable.

[WARNING]
====
There are some points to take into consideration before setting secrets in environment variables:

* Size of the content is restricted.
* Environment variables are passed to all children process.
* Environment variables might be printed in the console/logs in differents circumstances like crash logs or introspection toolings.
* Docker inspect, Docker exec might show all environment variables easily.
====

Undeploy the application by running:

[source, shell-session]
----
kubectl delete -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes/deploygreetingenv.yml

serviceaccount "greeting" deleted
service "greeting" deleted
deployment.apps "greeting" deleted
----

=== Using secrets as files

You can inject secrets in a volume.

Let's inject the previous secrets in a volume instead of an environment variables.

[source, shell-session]
----
kubectl apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes/deploygreetingvol.yml

serviceaccount/greeting created
service/greeting created
deployment.apps/greeting created
----

Important part of the previous deployment file:

[source, yaml]
.deploygreetingvol.yml
----
include::example$deploygreetingvol.yml[tags=spec, indent=0]
----
<1> Path where secrets are stored.
<2> Secret name to get the secrets.

:podname: greeting-75685d6668-szt8d
include::partial$exec_pod.adoc[]

Inside the pod:

[source, shell-session]
----
bash-4.4$ ls /etc/dbsec
password  username // <1>

bash-4.4$ cat /etc/dbsec/username
devuser // <2>
----
<1> Each key of the secret is mapped as a file.
<2> Content of the file is the secret.

Undeploy the application by running:

[source, shell-session]
----
kubectl delete -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes/deploygreetingvol.yml

serviceaccount "greeting" deleted
service "greeting" deleted
deployment.apps "greeting" deleted
----

To add the `application.properties` file as a secret, you do not need to do anything special.

[source, shell-session]
----
kubectl apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes/deploygreetingquarkus.yml

serviceaccount/greeting created
service/greeting created
deployment.apps/greeting created
----

Important part of the previous deployment file:

[source, yaml]
.deploygreetingquarkus.yml
----
include::example$deploygreetingquarkus.yml[tags=spec, indent=0]
----
<1> Path where secrets are stored.
<2> Secrets name defined as `application.properties`.

:podname: greeting-75685d6668-szt8d
include::partial$exec_pod.adoc[]

Inside the pod:

[source, shell-session]
----
bash-4.4$ cat /etc/dbsec/application.properties

username=devuser
password=devpassword
----

Undeploy the application by running:

[source, shell-session]
----
kubectl delete -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes/deploygreetingquarkus.yml

serviceaccount "greeting" deleted
service "greeting" deleted
deployment.apps "greeting" deleted
----

[#aresecretssecrets]
== Are secrets really secret?

All the time, you are reading that these secrets can contain sensitive information and the way of dealing is by using Kubernetes secrets.
Secrets are stored in `etcd` and by default they are not encrypted but stored in base64 format.
Obviously, this is not an ecryption method but an encoding method.

.Secrets are encoded in base 64.
image::sec.001.png[]

The big problem is that anyone who has access to `etcd` has access to all your secrets.
Any backup of the `etcd` contains the secrets in plain text.
Any log line might contain the secret.
When `etcd` is persisted to disk, any access to the disk can reveal the secrets.

To validate that secrets are not encrypted by default in `etcd`, run the next commands:

:etcdpath: /registry/secrets/default/db-secret
include::partial$etcdctl.adoc[]

And the output:

[source, shell-session]
----
/registry/secrets/default/db-secret
k8s

	db-secretdefault"*$df9e87f7-4eed-4f5b-985a-7888919198472�׮�z

        devpassword // <1>
usernamedevuserOpaque"
----
<1> Secrets are not encrypted but stored in plain text.

[TIP]
====
In case `peer.key` or `peer.crt` cannot be found in the `/var/lib/minikube/certs/etcd/` folder, you can inspect the real folder by running:

`kubectl exec -it etcd-minikube -n kube-system sh`

And inspecting the correct directory.
====

After that, you can stop the port-forwarding process and proceed to solve this problem in the next section.

WARNING: Some cloud providers have encryption enabled by default. In this case, obvisouly, the output will be totally different.
